# Missing file libarclite_iphoneos.a (Xcode 14.3)

There have been reports of failed iOS builds when running on Xcode 14.3:

- [Missing file libarclite_iphoneos.a (Xcode 14.3)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75574268/missing-file-libarclite-iphoneos-a-xcode-14-3)

The error above can be resolved by setting the platform version to `13.0` in the Podfile:

```ruby
# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

Also, these changes are needed at the bottom of the `Podfile`

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  # Ensure pods also use the minimum deployment target set above
  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/64385584/436422
  puts 'Determining pod project minimum deployment target'

  pods_project = installer.pods_project
  deployment_target_key = 'IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'
  deployment_targets = pods_project.build_configurations.map{ |config| config.build_settings[deployment_target_key] }
  minimum_deployment_target = deployment_targets.min_by{ |version| Gem::Version.new(version) }

  puts 'Minimal deployment target is ' + minimum_deployment_target
  puts 'Setting each pod deployment target to ' + minimum_deployment_target

  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      #config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
      config.build_settings[deployment_target_key] = minimum_deployment_target
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, set the deployment version to `13.0` in the Xcode project settings.
